# jdjg-fileserver
The File Server for storing different clips and media that was previously stored in google drive.

Goals:
It needs to be able to store pdfs, jpgs and mp4s, and preferably also pngs.

Next, it needs to have the og name, localized name if it's nintendo switch captures or screenshots.
There needs to be a private password + specific source for where uploads come from.
Mime type, name, og_name, and more need to be stored in the data.

It needs to sort by date (very important)
I am not sure about the rest.
